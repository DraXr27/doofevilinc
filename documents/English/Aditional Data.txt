*************************************** Recommendations and Additional Information ************************************


Data sent by the Professor, which could be useful in the development of this project.
Some of them are really important (some redundant, but still good to remember).


------------------------------------------------------ Github Repo ----------------------------------------------------


- Create the Github (or GitLab) repo with a basic Flask + Pymongo project.
- Diagram and understand how the structure of the collections and the document will be, together with their properties
	and attributes.
- Choose a CSS Framework to become familiar with it.
	(Recommended to read: https://dev.to/shubhadip_bhowmik/top-6-best-css-frameworks-in-2023-2eff)
- Write a base.html with a layout that allows solving the exercise (and that is well structured),
	Also, since the project is relatively complex (talking about functions), the layout should include
	a navigation bar that allows easy access to various functions without much difficulty.
- Provide access to the teacher to review the proyect (bruh).


----------------------------------------------------- MongoDB Atlas ---------------------------------------------------


- Be very careful with the DB connection string within the code, since the repositories uploaded to Github
	are public and should not contain sensitive information within the code, because it could later be modified by
	malicious third parties to exploit the system.


-------------------------------------------------------- Python -------------------------------------------------------


* (Continuing with what was said in the MongoDB Atlas section)
- Investigate how to use environment variables, define your venv and don't push it to the repository (add it to
	gitIgnore).(Recommended to read: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore,
	it's a very complete gitIgnore for Python, this assumes that the venv is called venv (bruhÂ²) so it would be 
	a good practice to call it this way)
- Create requirements.txt in the root of the repository using pip freeze, a good practice to install the necessary
	packages.
- Necessary packages and commands included in the requirements.txt:
   - python -m create venv (Create the virtual environment)
   - pip install flask (Install Flask)
   - pip install pymongo (Install PyMongo)


-------------------------------------------------------- Update -------------------------------------------------------


Pending of new useful data, this space is reserved for the moment.

****************************************************** Development Diary **************************************************


A development journal made to keep track of progress and personal thoughts about the project.
It may be useful to see a slightly more detailed description of what changes between commits.
Although, it could also contain some other nonsense that I wrote (or that I did in the program) to vent,
think, or remember to fix something (probably also propose fixes)
There won't be many hyperlinks in this text, to avoid hindering the reading too much. ;)


----------------------------------------------------------- Diary ---------------------------------------------------------


Day 1 (Tuesday, 01/08/23):
- Personal:
    Well, to begin with, I was late for class (due to an errand) and I missed the explanation of the statement xd.
	The good thing is that it was well written, and the Professor explained me what i didn't understood, so,
	everything fine. I started to summarize the main statement with some suggestions and ideas for variables and
 	such, in order to avoid big mistakes, since time is gold with this project (and yet I am here writing 
	this, but who knows, it might come in handy). I came to write several ideas of the main statement, up to the
	section of the lists.


- Changes made in the Project:
   - I only created the Main Statement file and got to the lists section.


- TODOs:
   - Finish with the Main Statement, and write some more in the documentation. (Done)




Day 2 (Thursday, 03/08/23):
- Personal:
    Well, yesterday I didn't do anything related to the project, but I thought about it a bit.
	Today, after a while, I decided to open it again and finish with the Main Statement.
	Besides that, I also wrote some useful Additional Data for the project, and a small
	Development Schedule to divide the work into stages and be clearer on what to do and when to
	do it. Although I think I got a little excited writing it xd.
	That's why I created this journal, I can use it to write down the funny things that come to my mind
	and maintain the formality in the other documents.
	It can also be useful for keeping track of file changes and overall progress.
	Speaking of documentation and planning of the project, that stage is almost complete (I hope).
	I wrote the base of almost all the documentation, I only need to correct some things, translate it and
	investigate some plugins to use in the project (CSS Library, PythonAnywhere, MongoDB Atlas,
	ChartJS, etc.).


- Changes made to the Project:
   - The Main Statement was edited, so far, it's complete. It could be modified in the future.
   - The Additional Data and Development Schedule were created, so far, they are almost complete.
   - The Development Diary was created, to keep changes and ideas of the project while it progresses.


- TODOs:
   - Edit Additional Data to maintain formality. (Done)
   - Finish the Details of Stage 4 and 5 in the Development Schedule. Edit to maintain formality. (Done)
   - Investigate about the complements that are going to be used in the project. (Done)
   - Translate the documentation. (Done)
   - Create (at least) the project folders and the python executable file. (Done)




Day 3 (Friday, 04/08/23):
- Personal:
    After correcting the documentation, I can finally start investigating (I didn't want to but I still have to xd)
	I'm doing some research now, gonna experiment at this basic stage and try MD3 and Materialize,
	if they don't convince me, I will use Bootstrap again.
	(After some reading, I think I'm going to use MD2, it looks good and it doesn't seem too bad)

	I also searched about PythonAnywhere, it's a pretty simple and complete service (runs on linux server), 
	with some limitations, but I found an article detailing how we can maintain a Github project here.
	(Read: https://medium.com/@aadibajpai/deploying-to-pythonanywhere-via-github-6f967956e664)
	(Read: https://pythonhow.com/python-tutorial/flask/deploy-flask-web-app-pythonanywhere/)

	After reading that, I investigated how to connect MongoDB Atlas to the files we'll upload in PythonAnywhere.
	(which will come from the Github repository)
	(Read: https://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
	(Read: https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/MongoDB)
	(Read: https://www.mongodb.com/compatibility/setting-up-flask-with-mongodb)
	(Read: https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/awslambda-pymongo/)
	(Read: https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/secure-way-to-connect-to-mongodb-atlas-from-pythonanywhere/14323)
	(Read: https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/atlas.html)

	And finally, I did research on ChartJS, it's very easy to use, it would be a nice extra step.
	(Read: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/installation.html)
	(Read: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_graphics_chartjs.asp)


- Changes made in the Project:
   - The Additional Data and the Development Schedule were edited.
   - The components to be used in the project were investigated.
   - The documentation is being translated.


- TODOs:
   - Finish translating the documentation (Done)
   - Create the initial files of the project (Done)




Day 4 (Sunday, 06/08/23):
- Personal:
    I think it's a bit obvious that yesterday I did absolutely nothing, and not because I didn't want to (I mean,
	I didn't feel like it but I might as well have done something), I was out of my house all day and I couldn't 
	edit anything in relation to this project.
	After talking with the Professor, I confirmed that there's no issue if I use Flask-Pymongo in my project,
	and that if I wish, I can make the connection with the DB and PythonAnywhere from now (the beginning), which
	seems better, since adding content the connection would already be made and it would save me having to adapt it
	in the future.
	I plan to finish translating the documentation today, and do the basic login already from PythonAnywhere with
	MongoDB Atlas. To verify that the connection is well made and the data is saved as it should be.


- Changes made in the Project:
   - Finally ended the documentation translation.
   - Thinked a bit on what to do next.


- TODOs:
   - Create the initial files of the project (Done)




Day 5 (Monday, 07/08/23):
- Personal:
    Oh boi, I FINALLY created the initial files of the proyect, After 5 days of investigating (and procrastinating
	around just because I was so lazy to create them lol).
	I created the user methods and some example methods that will be usefull later.
	Also did the basic DB conection file and user validator, only thing left for first test is making the base.html
	and user related html files, in first test, i will connect to DB from PythonAnywhere, so it will be like,
	a small thing rn, but it could help a lot in the future.


- Changes made in the Project:
   - Finally started creating the files (and I mean, FINALLY)
   - Made all the user methods.


- TODOs:
   - Create base.html and user related htmls
   - Connect to DB and test if it works (hope)




---------------------------------------------------------- Summary --------------------------------------------------------


Reserved in case I have to place something here.
It could be a brief summary, with a farewell, it would be nice.

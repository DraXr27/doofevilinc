************************************************ Program Development Stages *******************************************


Small reference list to get an idea of how the program will be developed.
Created with the purpose of avoiding any mistake at an advanced point of development.
This, along with the variables defined in the Main Statement, will be very useful in the long run.


----------------------------------------------------- List of Stages --------------------------------------------------


Stage 1 (Start: 02/08/23 - End: 07/08/23):
- Main Statement analysis.
- Proposition of variables and objects.
- Research prior to the start of the project.
- Creation of documentation.


Stage 2 (Start: 07/08/23 - End: -):
- Creation of the project itself.
- Add all the basic data for the program operation.
- Add basic HTML, CSS and JS.
- Add the basic authentication system. (Read Details - Stage 2)
- Add necessary basic validations and fix serious bugs.
- Connect with MongoDB.
- Get to a functional version of the program.
- Upload the files with Git.
- Make the Git - Github - PythonAnywhere - MongoDb Atlas connection.
- Update the documentation in case of changes.


Stage 3 (Start: - - End: -):
- Polish what was created in the previous stage, both functionally and visually.
- Make all the necessary fixes and correct errors (minors and, in the worst case, serious ones).
- Polish the validations as best as possible.
- Polish the CSS with animations and interfaces, and refine the JS.
- Update the documentation in case of changes.


Stage 4 (Start: - - End: 08/15/23):
- Make the project extras.
- Use a ChartJS type library to display data in reports.
- Deploy the project to an online service (such as PythonAnywhere).
- Research how to connect with MongoDB Atlas (free tier, has limitations).
- Make the program work remotely.


-------------------------------------------------- Details - Stage 1 --------------------------------------------------


Stage 1 of the project it's about the deep analysis of the statement, various proposals and ideas that must be
organized to avoid delays in the near future.
A brief research on various components that will be used in the project to know the basics about them
(CSS Library, PythonAnywhere, MongoDB Atlas, ChartJS, etc.).
And also the creation of this "documentation" (Development Diary included).


-------------------------------------------------- Details - Stage 2 --------------------------------------------------


Stage 2 of the project (probably the longest stage) is starting the development of the program,
mainly creating the virtual environment, installing Flask, MongoPy and updating pip.
Creating the base.html and adding the CSS framework that was already investigated, as well as the JS.
Now, the basic username-password authentication system will be created (It's an extra, but it's better to
implement it on early development, breaking functional code near the deadline would be horrible).
Then, the collections (categories, exams and indications) will be created in the DB, also adding the code that
allows to create a basic CRUD between the DB and the program, and fixing the serious errors that could appear.
After reaching a "stable" version, the files will be pushed to the repository using a git commit
(without forgetting to configure the gitignore), and the documentation will be updated if necessary.


-------------------------------------------------- Details - Stage 3 --------------------------------------------------


Stage 3 of the project deals with the final steps in terms of main development, polishing the features
and validations of the program, beautifying the program to arrive at an almost finished product.
Although this stage may not be as long as Stage 2, it may take time, but it's good, because
the more the program can be polished, the better it will look, and work.
If time runs out, the project could end at this stage, let's hope that's not the case.


-------------------------------------------------- Details - Stage 4 --------------------------------------------------


Stage 4 of the project is actually the extras, which will give additional points.
They are not obligatory, but those extra points won't be bad.
They'll done at the end, so they don't prevent the finishing of the main project.
